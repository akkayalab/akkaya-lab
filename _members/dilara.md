Hi, my name is Dilara and I am a fourth-year undergraduate student here at The Ohio State University, majoring in Biomedical Engineering with a minor in History. I was born in and raised in Michigan, but later moved to Columbus, Ohio. I work as an undergraduate student researcher on the T-cell side of the Akkaya Lab. My hobbies consist of traveling, painting, and spending quality with my friends and family.
